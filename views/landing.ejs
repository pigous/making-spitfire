        <p>"The Spitfire" is as much a design icon today as it was when it first flew in 1936. Considered by many to be one the greatest aircraft ever made and one of the most successful marriages of design and function. Its vital role in 'The Battle of Britain' merely serving to confirm its place at the very pinnacle of British engineering and design.
  However, despite a vast library of books, articles and documentaries charting the history of the aircraft, and those who flew it, surprisingly little is known about the people who actually designed and built the plane. Although the name of Chief Designer, R.J. Mitchell, is almost as ingrained in the British psyche as the aircraft itself, he was just one of the many "Supermariners" who designed, tested and built the Spitfire but whose names and roles are largely forgotten.
  
  The project aims to look at who those forgotten individuals were and what they experienced, to encourage the collection of more stories of those "who were there" and to present the information in a way that is accessible to all.
  
  It also seeks to help to inspire a new generation of designers and engineers through an understanding of how the icon Spitfire was created
